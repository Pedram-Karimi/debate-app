How the debate rooms work:

You enter a debate room by clicking on a debate box - can be anywhere in the app, or even external link- 
in the debate room, there are replies to the original post. people can like or dislike posts. this will not effect the visablity of that post. all kinds of interactions with a post will boot it. negative or positive.

How replies work:
Person writing the reply state his opinion, and decide his debate status, ready or not. ready means that
he is waiting for someone to chalange him on his opinion.  
the person who chalanges him along with himself can decide to make the debate public or private. if its public others can see your debate live. 
Viewers can also vote each person in a 1v1 debate. but the debaters themselve will not see the likes or dislikes.
